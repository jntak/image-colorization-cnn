# Image-colorization-CNN
## Deep Transfer Learning for converting grayscale images to colored images.

This repo involves using a convolutional neural network to convert the grayscale images to RGB images.

Image colorization involves taking an input grayscale (black & white) image and then producing an output colorized image that represents the semantic colors and tones of the input.

Here, `autoencoders` was used for image colorization, and the `VGG16 model` was used as a feature extractor.
