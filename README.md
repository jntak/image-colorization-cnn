# Deep Transfer Learning for Image Colorization


This repository contains code for colorizing grayscale images using deep transfer learning.


Image colorization involves taking an input grayscale (black & white) image and then producing an output colorized image (RGB) that represents the semantic colors and tones of the input. Using the `Autoencoder` model and by leveraging `VGG16` as a feature extractor, we can transfer knowledge to the task of image colorization.
